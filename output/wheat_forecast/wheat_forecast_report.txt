--- HISTORICAL ANALOG CONTEXT ---

  Soleimani Strike 2020          +  1%  -> $583/bu  (peaked in 1 days)

--- KEY RISK FACTORS ---
  1. Strait of Hormuz: 20 mb/d oil flow; only 21% bypass capacity
     - Iran has 5,000-6,000 naval mines, 100/day laying rate
     - US MCM gap: Avenger class decommissioned, LCS replacement unproven
     - Insurance halt at ~0.5% war-risk premium (Red Sea precedent)
  2. Oil->Wheat Transmission: 0.12 historical 1-month elasticity
     - Calibrated from Gulf War I (0.107), Iraq War (0.216), Jun 2025 (0.278)
     - Plus direct wheat trade disruption from config per level
  3. Proxy Amplification: Houthis + Hezbollah = 1.2x multiplier
     - Red Sea already saw 70% traffic decline, 58% Suez drop
  4. Wheat Fundamentals: Global stocks-to-use ratio near 5-year lows
     - Black Sea corridor uncertainty persists
     - Iran itself imports ~7M tonnes/year of wheat

--- METHODOLOGY ---
  Base volatility: EGARCH(1,1) with skewed-t innovations
  Contagion: 3-channel oil->wheat (direct + fertiliser + freight)
  Escalation: 4-level Markov chain with Hawkes self-excitation
  Simulation: 10,000 Monte Carlo paths, antithetic variance reduction
  Data: CBOT wheat futures (ZW=F) via yfinance, 5-year history
